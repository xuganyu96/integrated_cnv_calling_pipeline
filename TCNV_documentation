This file explains the format with which my integrated CNV calling pipeline stores CNV calls, which I will use .tcnv as extension, standing for "tabular CNV"

.tcnv will be a tab delimited rectangular data matrix with the following specification for individual columns. With Python's pandas' package, all data will be of the type "str" and numerical values to be converted to numerical data type only when computations are needed.

column 1: sample_name
    Sample name is defined to be the filename of the raw .bam file
    For example, for '18-X-149.realigned.bam', the sample name will be
    '18-X-149.realigned'
column 2: chromosome
    Name of the chromosome with the "chr" prefix
column 3: start
column 4: stop
column 5: state
    Either "del" or "dup", always lower case
column 6: q_some
    Phred-scaled quality of any CNV being in this interval
    If not available, use "nan"
column 7: caller
    name of the caller algorithm

Finally, there should not be row indices, but there will be a header
